Specifically, it targets the BDEUILauncher Class (CLSID ab93b6f1-be76-4185-a488-a9001b105b94)\nwhich can launch BaaUpdate.exe, which is vulnerable to COM Hijacking when started with input parameters.

This behavior is commonly associated with malware loaders or droppers that aim to bypass static detection\nby hiding intent in runtime-generated strings and using legitimate tools for code execution.
